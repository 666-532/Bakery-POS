# Bakery POS System  
I made this for my second semester Database Systems project. This basically streamlines several bakery management processes.  
## Project Details:  
1. This isn't a dummy project. We were required to find a real client.
2. We were allowed to use anything to make the frontend. We chose C# (Winforms).
3. Using MySQL was a must.
4. This was a group project. Total number of members for the group was 4.
5. We were required to follow SDLC.
